# Dashboard for Practice level Prescribing data
# Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide an interactive prescribing dashboard for practice level prescribing data.

# About
The data on the dashboard is provided by NHS digital. It includes details of prescribing data and that of prescribed medications. We used British National Formulary (BNF) codes 
to attain sound up-to-date information about the use of medicines. The BNF includes important information on the selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines.
